# Modules - Learn Flask Fundamentals

This folder contains instructional content that teaches you how to install, understand, and use Flask to build full-stack web applications.

## 📚 Purpose

The modules in this folder are **learning materials** that help you:
- Install and set up Flask properly
- Understand web application architecture
- Learn security best practices
- Master debugging and testing techniques

These are **not coding projects** - they are guides to read and understand before you start building applications in the [projects](../projects/) folder.

## 🎯 Module Structure

Each module includes:
- Detailed explanations of concepts
- Code examples to illustrate ideas
- Best practices and patterns
- Resources for further learning

## 📖 Available Modules

Read these modules in order before starting projects:

### Module 0: [Flask Setup & Installation](./00-flask-setup/)

**Time:** 30 minutes

Learn to install and configure Flask:
- Installing Flask and dependencies
- Creating virtual environments
- Understanding Flask project structure
- Your first Flask application
- Routes, templates, and static files

- Password hashing (bcrypt, pbkdf2)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Session security

**Read this early** to build secure applications from the start. Review before each project.

---

### Module 3: [Debugging & Testing](./07-debugging-testing/)
**Type:** Reference Guide  
**Time:** As needed

Professional development practices:
- Logging techniques
- Python debugger (pdb)
- Error handling patterns
- Testing with pytest
- Common debugging scenarios
- Flask Debug Toolbar

**Use as a reference** when you encounter issues or want to improve your debugging skills.

## 🚀 How to Use These Modules

### 1. Read in Order
Start with Module 0 (Flask Setup) and work your way through:
```
00-flask-setup → 01-architecture-primer → 06-security-basics → 07-debugging-testing
```

### 2. Take Your Time
These are learning materials, not exercises:
- Read carefully and take notes
- Try the code examples
- Understand the concepts, don't just skim
- Ask questions if something is unclear

### 3. Revisit When Needed
Come back to these modules:
- **Flask Setup** - When setting up new projects
- **Architecture Primer** - When designing application structure
- **Security Basics** - Before each project and before production
- **Debugging & Testing** - When you encounter issues

### 4. Apply in Projects
After reading these modules, apply what you learned in the [projects](../projects/) folder:
- Notes App
- URL Shortener
- Simple Blog
- Inventory Tracker

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to complete all modules before starting projects?**  
A: Read Modules 0 and 1 first. Skim Module 2 (Security) and use Module 3 (Debugging) as reference.

**Q: Can I skip modules I already know?**  
A: Quick review is recommended even if familiar, but you can skip if confident.

**Q: How long should I spend on modules?**  
A: Take your time. Understanding is more important than speed. 2-4 hours total is typical.

**Q: Should I memorize everything?**  
A: No! Understand concepts and know where to find details. You'll memorize through practice.

**Q: Can I learn modules and projects simultaneously?**  
A: Not recommended. Understanding fundamentals first makes projects easier.
