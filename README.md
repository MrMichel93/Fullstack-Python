# Full-Stack Development with Python

**A Project-Based Course for Ages 16–20**

Learn full-stack web development by building real projects. This course focuses on practical skills, not theory. You'll build 4 portfolio-ready applications using Python, Flask/FastAPI, HTML, CSS, and SQLite.

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, loops)
- Basic HTML knowledge (tags, forms)
- No prior web development experience required

## Course Structure

### 📚 [1. Architecture Primer](./01-architecture-primer/)
Learn the fundamentals:
- Client vs Server architecture
- Request/Response lifecycle
- How data flows through a web app

### 🛠️ Mini Projects

Build real applications with TODO-driven labs:

1. **[Notes App](./02-notes-app/)** - Learn CRUD operations and form handling
   - Backend: Basic routing, database operations
   - Frontend: Forms, dynamic content display
   
2. **[URL Shortener](./03-url-shortener/)** - Master routing and redirects
   - Backend: URL generation, redirects, database queries
   - Frontend: Input validation, result display
   
3. **[Simple Blog](./04-simple-blog/)** - Work with templates and static files
   - Backend: Multi-page routing, user sessions
   - Frontend: Navigation, CSS styling, post listings
   
4. **[Inventory Tracker](./05-inventory-tracker/)** - Add authentication and validation
   - Backend: User authentication, data validation
   - Frontend: Login forms, protected pages

### 🔒 [5. Security Basics](./06-security-basics/)
Essential security practices:
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Common vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF)

### 🐛 [6. Debugging & Testing](./07-debugging-testing/)
Professional development practices:
- Logging techniques
- Error handling patterns
- Debugging strategies

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask or FastAPI
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, minimal JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Python**: 3.8+

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Python 3.8 or higher

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Learning Path

1. Read the Architecture Primer
2. Choose Flask OR FastAPI (examples provided for both)
3. Complete each project in order
4. Review Security Basics before building your own apps
5. Use Debugging & Testing guide as reference

## Support
